        "a": "Correct answer is (d). This option provides two frequency values, but they do not match the calculated natural frequencies for the given system parameters.",

        "a": "Correct answer is (a). The mode shapes represent the ratio of the amplitudes of the two masses vibrating at each natural frequency. For the first natural frequency (lower value), the ratio X<sub>1</sub>/X<sub>2</sub> is approximately 0.7533. For the second natural frequency (higher value), the ratio X<sub>1</sub>/X<sub>2</sub> is approximately 1.5490.",
