## Assumptions
•	The springs have no masses.
<br>
•	No dampers are provided.

## Description

1.	At first page, the page will be displayed as shown below:

<br>
2. Change the values of initial excitation given to masses m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> (X<sub>o1</sub> and X<sub>o2</sub>). So that, the motion of masses will be initiated to the input given.

3.	You can change the stiffness constants k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub>, value of masses m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> according to your convenience and can check the output response of system.

4. You can pause the animation by clicking the  ![](images/Procedure/3.png)  button.

5.	To play the animation again, click ![](images/Procedure/4.png)   button.

6.	If you want to check the values of natural frequencies, their respective mode shape ratios and equation of motion of masses m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>, you can click  ![](images/Procedure/5.png)  button. The representation of second page is shown below:
